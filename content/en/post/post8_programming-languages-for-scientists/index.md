## General information

In computer programming, a scientific programming language can refer to two degrees of the same concept.

Broadly speaking, a scientific programming language is a programming language that is widely used for computational science and computational mathematics. In this sense, C/C + + and Python can be considered scientific programming languages.

More broadly, a scientific programming language is one that is designed and optimized to use mathematical formulas and matrices. Such languages ​ ​ are characterized not only by the presence of libraries that perform mathematical or scientific functions, but also by the syntax of the language itself. For example, neither C++ nor Python have embedded matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication, etc.); instead, this functionality is made available through standard libraries.

Scientific programming languages should not be confused with scientific language in general, which broadly refers to the higher standards of accuracy, correctness, and compactness expected of practitioners of the scientific method.
