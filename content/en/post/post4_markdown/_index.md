## General information

Lightweight markup languages ​ ​ are used in applications where users can be tricked into reading the original document as well as a properly rendered document. For example, Wikipedia articles are written using a lightweight markup language, wiki text.

Another example is that a person loading a software library may prefer to read documentation in a text editor rather than a web browser.

The main use of these languages is to enter content for a website involving various authors, such as blogs and wikis, for which the only guaranteed interface available to all authors is a simple text field.
