## Monday is Warframe Day

On Monday, I finally finished all the tasks for getting Excalibur Umbra (spent 3 days on this) in Warframe. Check out this handsome frame:

Now I'm targeting Gauss Prime. Here it is:

## Tuesday - something on tired

Nothing interesting happened on Tuesday. Unless I came tired after PE.

## Wednesday and Thursday - I'm a sleepy fly

Not only do you need to get up at 5:20 these days, you also put two controls (mathematical logic and analytic geometry) on thursday.
On Wednesday, after a couple of rides, I went home preparing for the test.
Thursday is doomsday. Firstly, the wire at the station broke in Odintsovo, which is why Dima, Yegor and Lyokha and I sat on Pionerskaya for an hour, but sat cheerfully. Secondly, we wrote the controls, and, it seems, I am very dissatisfied with the angema, because I got frankly fig numbers, which is why I was dumb a lot and decided not everything. I am more or less satisfied with the control matlogue.

## Friday - something on foreign

Having slept after two difficult days, I served two pairs in foreign languages ​ ​ and went home, where I sat and farmed until 5 AM.

## Saturday - Lab Day

Today I sit and make foreheads from 2 PM. I didn't go to history because I don't want to.

## Sunday

The day is not open, buy a subscription for $10 to open this day of the week.

## Summing up

I did not begin to devote more time to study and sleep, but I began to engage in physical development.

Good luck, my dear reader!
